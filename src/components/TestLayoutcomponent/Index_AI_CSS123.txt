Style (CSS) code:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* Arrange items vertically */
  gap: 10px;         /* Spacing between items */
}

label {
  font-weight: bold;
}

input[type="text"] {
  padding: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #ccc;
  border-radius: 4px;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```

This setup includes a TypeScript interface for type safety and better maintainability. Remember that in a Pega environment, you'd typically integrate this with the Pega platform using specific APIs and directives, but this provides the basic component structure.
