CSS (using CSS Modules - LoanApplicationsTable.module.css):

```css
.loan-applications-table {
  width: 100%;
  border-collapse: collapse;
  margin-top: 20px; /* Add some spacing */
}


.loan-applications-table th,
.loan-applications-table td {
  padding: 8px;
  border: 1px solid #ddd;
  text-align: left; /* Align text to the left */

}

.loan-applications-table th {
  background-color: #f2f2f2; /* Light gray background for header */
  font-weight: bold;
}

.status-past-deadline {
  color: red; /* Example color for past deadline */
}


.status-in-progress {
  color: blue; /* Example color for in progress */
}

.status-resolved {
  color: green;  /* Example color for resolved */
}


```


Key improvements and explanations:

* **Typescript Interfaces:**  Using interfaces (`LoanApplication`, `LoanApplicationsTableProps`) significantly improves type safety and code clarity.
* **CSS Modules:**  `LoanApplicationsTable.module.css` provides better CSS encapsulation and avoids naming conflicts.
* **Dynamic Status Styling:**  The  `status-${application.applicationStatus.toLowerCase().replace(" ", "-")}`  className allows you to dynamically style the status column based on the application status, making it visually clear which applications are past due, in progress, or resolved.
* **Clearer CSS:**  Simplified and organized CSS for better readability.
* **Table Styling:** Added some basic table styling (border, padding, header background) for a better visual presentation.  You can customize the styling further as needed.
* **Accessibility:** `text-align: left;` improves readability and accessibility for users, especially those using screen readers.  Consider using semantic HTML elements for even better accessibility where possible.


How to use this code:

1.  Save the JSX as  `LoanApplicationsTable.tsx`, the CSS as  `LoanApplicationsTable.module.css`, and the JSON data in a  `.json`  file (e.g.,  `loanData.json`).
2.  Import the component and data into your main application file:

```tsx
import LoanApplicationsTable from './LoanApplicationsTable';
import loanData from './loanData.json';

const App: React.FC = () => {

  return (
    <div>
    <LoanApplicationsTable loanApplications={loanData} />
  </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

3.  Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed (React, Typescript, etc.).  A CSS Modules setup might also be needed depending on your project configuration.
